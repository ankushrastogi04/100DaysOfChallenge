# Given a string s, remove the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' from it, and return the new string.

# Input: s = "aeiou"

# Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
# Return the running sum of nums.

# Output: [1,3,6,10]

#  Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.

# For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

# Example 1:

# Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
# Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
# Explanation: 
# Kid 1 has 2 candies and if he or she receives all extra candies (3) will have 5 candies --- the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
# Kid 2 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
# Kid 3 has 5 candies and this is already the greatest number of candies among the kids. 
# Kid 4 has 1 candy and even if he or she receives all extra candies will only have 4 candies. 
# Kid 5 has 3 candies and if he or she receives at least 2 extra candies will have the greatest number of candies among the kids.

#  Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
# Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
# Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

# You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

# You own a Goal Parser that can interpret a string command. The command consists of an alphabet of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret "G" as the string "G", "()" as the string "o", and "(al)" as the string "al". The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.

# Given the string command, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of command.

# Example 1:

# Input: command = "G()(al)"
# Output: "Goal"
# Explanation: The Goal Parser interprets the command as follows:
# G -> G
# () -> o
# (al) -> al
# The final concatenated result is "Goal".
